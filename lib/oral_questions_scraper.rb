# NOTE about Capybara

# IMPORTANT! Some of the defaults have changed in Capybara 2.1. If you're experiencing failures,
# please revert to the old behaviour by setting:

#     Capybara.configure do |config|
#       config.match = :one
#       config.exact_options = true
#       config.ignore_hidden_elements = true
#       config.visible_text_only = true
#     end

# If you're migrating from Capybara 1.x, try:

#     Capybara.configure do |config|
#       config.match = :prefer_exact
#       config.ignore_hidden_elements = false
#     end
